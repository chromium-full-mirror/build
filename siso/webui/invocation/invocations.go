// Provider is a strategy that owns one or more invocations.
//
// For example:
//
//   - An outdir provider owns the lifecycle of finding all outdirs (out/Default,
//     out/Release, etc.) under a single workspace.
//   - Uploaded metric providers own multiple separate siso_metrics.json.
//
// All invocations are returned grouped as a [Series].

// Series groups one or more invocations that are related to each other,
// and webui offers cross-comparison functionality with them.
//
// For example, all invocations in the same outdir should be one series,
//
// We don't know whether multiple siso_metrics.json uploads came from the same
// outdir, so those should be grouped by themselves.
